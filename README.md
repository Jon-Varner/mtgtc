<h1>MAGIC: THE GATHERING: THE CREATURES</h1>

<p>This Web app fetches Creature-type cards from the MTG API (<a href="https://docs.magicthegathering.io/">https://docs.magicthegathering.io/</a>), which can then be sorted by Name, Type, Set, or Artist. The page will scroll infinitely, loading more Creature cards until there are no more left to return.
</p>

<p>Searching for any text will return a new set of cards with that text in the selected property (Name, Type, Set, or Artist).</p>

<p>The site can be viewed at <a href="https://mtgtc.herokuapp.com/">https://mtgtc.herokuapp.com/</a>.
